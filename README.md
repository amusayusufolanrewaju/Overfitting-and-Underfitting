# Overfitting-and-Underfitting
### ðŸŽ¯ Overfitting and Underfitting This section of the project explores two common modeling challenges in machine learning: overfitting and underfitting.
### ðŸ“Œ What is Overfitting?
##### Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers. As a result, it performs excellently on training data but poorly on unseen/test data. It's like memorizing instead of understanding.

##### Symptoms:

- High training accuracy

- Low test accuracy

- Solutions:

- Simplify the model

- Use regularization (L1/L2)

- Cross-validation

- More training data

### ðŸ“Œ What is Underfitting?
##### Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It performs poorly on both training and test sets.

##### Symptoms:

- Low accuracy on both training and test data

##### Solutions:

- Use a more complex model

- Add more relevant features

- Reduce regularization

### ðŸ§ª Implementation
##### In this project, we demonstrate both scenarios using a classification model with varying model complexities. Graphs and metrics are included to show how training vs. validation performance changes with model adjustments.
